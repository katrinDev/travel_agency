The project presents an automated accounting system for the activities of a company providing tourism services.
After choosing a role (either a director or an employee) and passing an authentication, the user is offered an appropriate set of data managing actions.
The director, unlike the company's employees, has an ability to manage users and see the info about the most requested tour.
The employees, in turn, can add, delete, edit the orders information.

To log in as a director: login - admin; password - travel.
To log in as an employee: login - user1; password - beyourself.
All the credentials are stored in encrypted form in the file Files/Users.txt
